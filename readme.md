In today’s world, dictators compel their subjects to wage unjust and bloody wars, forcing victims into a grim choice: resist at the cost of their own blood, or submit to tyranny and become mere slaves—cannon fodder for the next expansion of despotic empires.

Seventy-six years ago, over the ruins of the Third Reich, our forebears proclaimed a powerful truth: “The dignity of man shall be inviolable.” Yet today, authoritarian regimes like Russia and North Korea trample upon this principle, disrespecting the dignity of others and even their own people. As society becomes numb and normalizes their bombing of cities, children’s hospitals, their “human safari” in Kherson, and human wave attacks using their own soldiers, these dictators exploit advanced technologies to further their oppressive agendas. They deploy autonomous weapons powered by machine learning across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. They repurpose neural network object detection, originally developed for peaceful purposes, to guide attack drones and missiles. They harness large language models to create propaganda bots and censorship tools, using machine learning to spread their lies with precision, and employ robotics to enforce their will on the ground. The entire free world, along with every individual’s liberty, faces an unprecedented threat.

We, the people of the free world, refuse to be terrorized by this evil combination of technological misuse and blatant disregard for human life. We firmly believe that machine learning tools must serve humanity and protect our freedom, rather than assist tyrants in imposing their will upon others. While we abhor war and violence and stand for just peace, we also recognize the cost of abandoning our principles and the peril of appeasing evil, much like the false promise of “peace for our time” in the Munich betrayal.

To this end, we advocate the development of autonomous and human-in-the-loop combined unmanned combat systems. By utilizing general flight control hardware paired with various aircraft designs, we aim to secure frontline air superiority. Unlike the traditional definition of air superiority, this concept focuses on low-altitude, slow-speed, and small targets operating within a 10 to 100-kilometer range. The purpose of such operations is to conduct Combat Air Patrol (CAP) missions to neutralize enemy drones, denying them the use of these airspaces for attacks—such as kamikaze drones and drone bombers—or for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) activities using multi-rotor or small fixed-wing UAVs. We intend to perform Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) operations against enemy forces in these areas, creating conditions for our own use of this airspace. By deploying disposable and reusable drones, we can provide close air support or conduct deep enemy air interdiction, striking high-value targets and critical nodes to gain tactical and even operational advantages.

Tyrants fear their own people and tirelessly work to deny them the technological means to protect their rights—just as ancient Chinese emperors forbade their subjects from owning armor, or how Redcoats feared the muskets and powder in the hands of Lexington’s residents. This fear is their weakness, and freedom will become our greatest strength.

Frontline air supremacy will permanently transform battlefield dynamics: human wave assaults will become ineffective, armored offensives will be rapidly detected and neutralized, and a new era of integrated air-land warfare built around these concepts will complete the missing puzzle piece needed for multi-domain superiority, making victories with less bloodshed possible.

The weak will no longer be powerless, and the mighty will no longer be unchallenged.
